File IO is designed for primitive data types

	but for custom datatype, we need to store object, and in a format (XML, JSON, binary...)

	Serialization - Save object from memory(RAM) to a storage(Disk / network)
	Deserializaion - Bring the object back from disk to ram
	
		XML and JSON formats are used
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		using System.Runtime.Serializtion;


	Serailization : When you want to persist the state of an object to a storage or network 
			use Serialization
			
			Process of bringing that object back into memory is called deserialization
