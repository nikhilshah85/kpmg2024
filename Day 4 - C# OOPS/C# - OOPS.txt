			C# - OOPS
	
	Object 
		Properties, methods
	Class
-------------------------------------------------------------
		Abstraction
		Encapsulation
		Inheritance
		Polymprphism

-------------------------------------------------------------------	
	Abstraction - (result of requirement understanding) 
			consider only those properties, methods which are in scope of object 			and application)
		Blood group is imp for an employee Obj ?
		Blood group is imp for a bank account ?
		Blood group is imp for a bank account ?

	Encapsulaption - (store data in a private variable only, and never share access of 				it to any 1 - even yourself)
			so we have properties (getter and setter)
			we have methods (60 lines of code, no one can see the logic in it)

	Inheritance - (re-use)

	polymprphism - same method name, same signature but different behaviour
		leave policy for emp
